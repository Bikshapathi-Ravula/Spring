
    NoSuchBeanDefinitionException:
        When it occurs: This exception is thrown when you try to retrieve a bean from the Spring ApplicationContext, 
                        but the requested bean definition is not found.
        Why it occurs: This can happen if you are trying to inject a bean that Spring doesn't know about or if there's a typo in the bean name.

        Description: This exception occurs when attempting to retrieve a bean from the container, but the requested bean definition is not found.
       Possible Causes: It can happen if there is a typo in the bean name or if the requested bean is not defined in the Spring configuration.
  
    BeanCreationException/BeanInitializationException:
        
         When it occurs: This exception is a general exception that can be thrown during the creation of a bean.
         Why it occurs: There are various reasons for this exception, including problems with the constructor of the bean,
                         circular dependencies, or if the bean's initialization method throws an exception.
         Description: This exception is thrown when the Spring container is unable to create an instance of a bean.
         Possible Causes: It can be caused by issues such as the inability to resolve dependencies,
                          problems with the bean's constructor, or exceptions thrown during the initialization of the bean.
         Description: Thrown when an error occurs during the initialization of a bean, usually in the bean's initialization method.
         Possible Causes: Issues within the bean's initialization code, such as runtime exceptions or errors.
    
 AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor$AutowiredFieldElement: Injection of autowired dependencies failed:
        When it occurs: This exception is thrown when Spring is unable to satisfy the dependencies marked with @Autowired annotation.
        Why it occurs: It can occur due to the unavailability of a suitable bean for injection, 
                       or if there are multiple candidates and Spring is unable to determine the correct one.

    UnsatisfiedDependencyException:
        When it occurs: This exception is thrown when a bean cannot be created due to unsatisfied dependencies.
        Why it occurs: It may occur when Spring cannot find a suitable candidate for autowiring or when there is a mismatch in the type of the dependency.


    BeanCurrentlyInCreationException:
        When it occurs: This exception is thrown when a bean is currently in creation and another attempt to create the same bean is made.
        Why it occurs: This can happen with circular dependencies where beans depend on each other,
                       and the container is not able to resolve the circular reference.

    NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException:
        When it occurs: This exception is thrown when there are multiple beans of the same type, and Spring is unable to determine which one to inject.
        Why it occurs: It occurs when there are multiple candidate beans of the same type, and Spring doesn't know which one to choose.

    IllegalStateException: Cannot convert value of type '...': no matching editors or conversion strategy found:
        When it occurs: This exception is thrown when Spring is unable to convert the value of a property to the required type during injection.
                        It may occur in situations like attempting to modify an immutable object or when trying to perform an operation that 
                        is not allowed in the current state.
        Why it occurs: It can occur if the value provided in the configuration or property file cannot be converted to the type expected by the bean.


UnsatisfiedDependencyException:

    Description: This exception is thrown when a bean has an unsatisfied dependency.
    Possible Causes: It can occur when Spring cannot find a suitable candidate for autowiring or when there is a mismatch in the type of the dependency.

IllegalStateException:

    Description: This exception can be thrown for various illegal state conditions.
    Possible Causes: It may occur in situations like attempting to modify an immutable object or when trying to perform an operation that is not allowed in the current state.

NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException:

    Description: Thrown when there are multiple beans of the same type, and Spring cannot determine which one to inject.
    Possible Causes: It occurs when there are multiple candidate beans of the same type, and Spring doesn't know which one to choose.

TransactionSystemException/DataAccessException:

    Description: This exception is related to transaction management and can be thrown when there are issues with the underlying transaction system.
    Possible Causes: Problems such as database connection issues, transaction timeout, or failure to commit or rollback a transaction
    Description: This is a generic exception for all data access issues.
    Possible Causes: It can be thrown for a variety of reasons, including database connection problems, SQL syntax errors, or issues with the underlying data store.

InvalidPropertyException:

    Description: Thrown when there is an attempt to set an invalid property on a bean.
    Possible Causes: It may occur if the property name is misspelled or if the value cannot be converted to the expected type.

ConversionNotSupportedException:

    Description: This exception is thrown when a required conversion is not supported.
    Possible Causes: It can occur when Spring attempts to convert a value from one type to another, but there is no suitable conversion strategy available
